/*
Olivia is right in the sweet spots in pretty much all the categories. The tempo, energy, danceability come in a variety of songs that have a BPM of 100 to a BPM of 180.
She sits around the average in most of the categories but makes her music in the major key and very acoustic. People must relate to the 
content of her music or really like more sad songs considering driverse licence and traitor are 2 of the bottom 3 songs by valence which is the mood of each song.
The fact she has 4 songs in the top 25 most listened to songs in the world indicte how popular she was in 2021 and made some of the best music of the year.
